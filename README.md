# DEPRECATED

This plugin project is no longer maintained.

I thought making a plugin to help dealing with mokey command would be cool years ago when I just started working on Android development, but for now, **I think a simple script file could do better**. 

# MonkeyMaster
An Intellij Idea plugin help android developer to deal with monkey test command. Pre-release now available for you, though it may be not that stable, but it works, ^_^~.

In the very beginning, MonkeyMaster may only support **WIN** os. I'm sure Linux support will be available in few days.

# 1. Setup
You will find MonkeyMaster in JetBrains repositories **when stable version is done**, before that, you have to install it manually:

  - Download [latest released jar](https://github.com/DrkCore/MonkeyMaster/releases/download/v1.0-alpha2/MonkeyMaster_v1.0-alpha2.jar).
  - File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Install plugin from disk -> Select jar file.
  - Restart Intellij Idea/Android Studio to enable plugin.

If nothing worng, MonkeyMaster tool panel will be present in the bottom sidebar, like this:

# 3. TODO

- Analyze logfile and locate problem.
- UI retrofit.
